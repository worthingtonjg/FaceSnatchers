# Description 

Keys: AWSD (MOVE) | Spacebar (Jump Host) | C (Toggle 4 Way Camera)

You are a race of parasitic mask like creatures called Face Snatchers. Once you've snatched a hosts face your decay timer starts. 

- Jump from host to host, but don't stay too long or your host dies and so do you.
- If you jump and miss, then you die.
- If another competing parasitic mask jumps into your host then you also die.

Earn the most points by jumping into the most hosts, being the last fast snatcher standing, and by killing competing face snatchers.

# Technology Notes
- I use NavMesh for all the AI Navigation
- The hosts are split into 4 zones - each zones has a set of points that the wander between
- The AI Face Snatchers algorithm is simple; Locate nearest host, follow until near, shoot face - ray tracing so projectile doesn't hit the wall
- Had the most fun creating the AI;
