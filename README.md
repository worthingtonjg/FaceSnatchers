You are a race of parasitic mask like creatures called Face Snatchers.  Once you've snatched a hosts face your indistinguishable from any other non-possessed.  Your goal is to be the last snatcher alive!  

Jump from host to host, but don't stay too long or your host dies and so do you.  
If you jump and miss, then you die.  
If another competing parasitic mask jumps into your host then you also die

Earn the most points by jumping into the most hosts, being the last fast snatcher standing, and by killing competing face snatchers.
